# Concurrent Traffic Simulation
![Sample Image](concurrency.png)
## Project Overview
In this project, I have simulated a traffic light at an intersection using concurrent programming in C++. I have used two real urban map of the cities of New York and Paris, where the traffic lights are timed to regulate the flow of traffic through the city streets. The map data is read by the OpenCV library. The code is written in C++ and is based on the starter code provided by Udacity.
